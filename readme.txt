Part 1: Macroeconomic Factors
Macroeconomic factors are economic stats that are released by the government and private organizations that provide insight into the economic performance of a particular country or region. These can be the GDP, unemployment rate, or consumption percentage. 

These stats can be influences by many factors, both finance-related and not. Hence, it is possible to think about factors such as weather and public sentiment as predictive of macroeconmic stats. 

In particular, we can look at weather patterns and how they affect US consumption.
