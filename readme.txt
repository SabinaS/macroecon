Part 1: Macroeconomic Factors
Macroeconomic factors are economic stats that are released by the government and 
private organizations that provide insight into the economic performance of a 
particular country or region. These can be the GDP, unemployment rate, or consumption percentage. 

These stats can be influences by many factors, both finance-related and not. 
Hence, it is possible to think about factors such as weather and public sentiment 
as predictive of macroeconmic stats. 

In particular, we can look at weather patterns and how they affect US consumption.

Part IV: Data Sources

For US Conspmtio ta, the Bureau of Economic Analysis provides national data for 
Personal Consumption Expenditures by Product Type. Their data goes back to 1959;
for the purposes of a quick POC, I will only use data for the past 20 years:
1998-2018, on a quarter by quarter basis.
